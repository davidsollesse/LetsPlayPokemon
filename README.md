Pokemon Stadium style game project in C#

This is similar to a pokemon stadium style game where a user can select three pokemon and square off against another 3 pokemon of the computer.
The first 483 pokemon are used (Gens 1-4) and each generations' battle mechanics. All pokemon can be used for all generations. 

Currently this project is still in work. I am still working on the first generation battle engine. There is also no AI.
